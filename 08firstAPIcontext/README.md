# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

***UserContextProvider**
const UserContextProvider =({childern})=>{} 
like outlet in prev project same type of concept we use here is children-> smae type of concept , whichever props we are getting as a children keep it as it is  childern aeere those divs and other components
